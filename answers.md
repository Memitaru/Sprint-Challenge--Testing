1. In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

Describe explains what the thing you are testing overall while it explains individual things it must be done.

For example, describe would explain what the goal of your function is while it would explain different cases and what you are expecting to get back.

1. What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

The goal is to create automatic testing at the start so you can plan your code with edge cases and possible errors in mind. I can see why it's useful. It helps you get a better idea of exactly what you need to write, what kinds of responses you need, and that kind of thing.

I can see why it's useful but so far it's felt kind of boring and not too useful in a lot of cases, but I also see a lot of cases where it's been helpful.

1. Mention three types of automated tests.

Unit tests
End to end tests
Integration tests
